                <button class="accordion">Tell me again, What is the difference between cyber warranty and cyber insurance?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p class="panel-content">To keep it simple, cyber insurance is like your car insurance. You pay a premium each month to protect you and your vehicle in the unlikely event of an accident. A cyber warranty is akin to your AAA membership or your protection plan at the dealership. It's complementary to your car insurance but the coverage extends to the everyday headaches, protecting you against a flat tire, a dead battery, etc. Cyber insurance generally covers liability for data breach involving sensitive customer information. It can help with costs like legal fees, data recovery, business interruption, customer notification, identity restoration and crisis communication. Insurance can be expensive and typically has a long manual and complex application and approval process. It can have higher policy limits with high deductibles. Cyber warranty bridges a key gap in the financial protection stack and can have advanced technology to prevent and mitigate cyber threats. It typically includes coverage for recovery costs, incident response or business interruption loss from certain cyber attacks. The Cork warranty specifically is designed to cover common cyber attacks (ransomware, phishing, business email compromise (BEC)) that target small and medium businesses, whereas cyber insurance is comprehensive protection that generally covers any and all cyber risks. As a result, the Cork cyber warranty does not require a deductible, making it more affordable for small and medium businesses.</p>
